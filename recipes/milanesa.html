    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Mexican version of the cotoletta alla Milanese served on a bun dressed
      with South-of-the-Border fixings. Spicy breaded chicken breast gets
      sandwiched between a toasted Mexican bun then topped with spicy spread,
      avocado, lettuce, tomato, and pickled vegetables.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>⅓ cup bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 bolillo rolls, sliced in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Valentina®)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil</li>
      <li>½ avocado, sliced</li>
      <li>3 slices tomato</li>
      <li>2 lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pickled carrots</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pickled jalapeno peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Seal chicken breast in a resealable zip-top plastic bag. Pound flat to
        1/4-inch thickness. Add cornstarch and shake to coat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Whisk egg in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken breast through the egg;
        leave it in the bowl. Add bread crumbs, cilantro, chipotle, oregano,
        cumin, and pepper to the bag; shake well. Lift chicken from the bowl,
        letting any excess egg drip off. Add to the bread crumb mixture. Shake
        and press the seasoned bread crumbs over the chicken breast.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place bolillo buns in the preheated oven until warmed through and
        toasted, about 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, mix mayonnaise and hot sauce together in a small mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until browned,
        about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut the
        chicken in half lengthwise.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Assemble the sandwiches. Spread the spicy mayonnaise over both sides of
        the rolls. Add equal amounts of avocado, tomato, lettuce, carrots, and
        jalapenos to 2 halves. Add chicken and the tops of the rolls. Serve with
        the remaining spicy mayonnaise for dipping.
      </li>
    </ol>
