## About

A simple webpage made during the foundations course on The Odin Project. Clicking on a recipe link will show the instructions and ingredients required to make the dish.

## Thoughts

This was my first project assignment with The Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to fill a basic HTML boilerplate, create directories and files usign the CLI on Linux, make self-explanatory commits, get to know HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, images, links, ordered and unordered lists.
